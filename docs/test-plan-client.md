## Test Plan for Client Side

### Introduction

- **Purpose:** Ensure all client-side functionalities and user interfaces work as intended.

- **Scope:**  Includes testing for UI components, user interactions, and API integrations on the frontend.

### Objectives

- Verify correctness and responsiveness of UI components.
- Identify and fix any bugs or UI issues.
- Validate user interactions and API communication.

### Testing Approach

- **Unit Tests:** Use Jest and React Testing Library for component testing.
- **Functional Tests:** Use Cypress for end-to-end testing of user flows.
- **Integration Tests:** Use Mock Service Worker (MSW) to mock API calls for integration tests.

### Test Environment

- **Setup:** Ensure the development environment is configured with necessary dependencies.
- **Data:** Use mock data and APIs for testing to ensure consistency and repeatability.

### Test Deliverables

- **Reports:** Test summary reports, defect reports, and test case execution logs.

### Test Case

#### 1. Functional Testing

- **Main Pages/Views**
  - **Home Page**
    - Test loading of the home page.
    - Test navigation to different sections from the home page.
  - **Property Listings**
    - Test display of property listings.
    - Test filtering and sorting of properties.
    - Test navigation to property details.
  - **User Authentication**
    - Test registration form validation and submission.
    - Test login form validation and submission.
    - Test logout functionality.

#### 2. Unit Testing

- **Components**
  - **Header Component**
    - Test rendering of the header.
    - Test navigation links in the header.
  - **Property Card Component**
    - Test rendering of property details.
    - Test interaction with the property card (e.g., clicking for more details).
  - **Filter Component**
    - Test rendering of filters.
    - Test filter selection and application.

#### 3. Integration Testing

- **APIs and Services**
  - **Property API**
    - Test fetching of property data.
    - Test error handling for API calls.
  - **Authentication API**
    - Test registration API calls.
    - Test login API calls.
    - Test token handling and validation.

#### 4. End-to-End Tests

- **User Registration/Login:** Verify the complete flow from user registration to login and accessing the dashboard.
- **Property post:** Test the user journey from posting a property to viewing details and making inquiries.
- **Property Search:** Test the user journey from searching for a property to viewing details and making inquiries.

### Example Test Case

- **Test Case ID:** TC001
- **Component:** Login.js
- **Test Case Description:** Verify form validation and submission
- **Preconditions:** Application running in test environment
- **Steps:**
    - Render the LoginForm component.
    - Enter valid email and password.
    - Click the submit button.
    - Verify form validation errors are not displayed.
    - Check that the form submission calls the correct API endpoint.
- **Expected Result:** Form should validate input correctly and submit to the API endpoint.

This test plan aims to cover functional aspects, component behavior, and integration with external services to ensure a robust and reliable client-side application
