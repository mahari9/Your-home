### Project Description

Your Home is a web-based platform designed to streamline the process of finding, connecting with, and managing housing options for both homeowners and renters. The platform aims to simplify the housing search by providing a user-friendly interface and efficient environment where homeowners can list their properties and buyers/renters can easily find and connect with potential homes.
